# Landing page Restaurant Template ðŸ’»

This is not a landing page as usual because it focuses on showing the latest promotions, menus, locations and redirect users to Instagram to finalize their purchases.

I created this template for restaurants that don't want to have a big #ecommerce and they prioritize the transactions on Instagram, WhatsApp or in the restaurant.
